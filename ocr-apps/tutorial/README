# BUILD
###

To build:
    - EXORSOL=<exercises|solutions> TARGET=<target> make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 install
    - EXORSOL indicates if you want to build the solutions or exercises. Note that the exercises
      will not compile as is as they are missing code
    - <target> can be one of ex1, ex2, ex3, ex4, or ex5
    - By default, the solution to ex1 will be build

Options:
    - You can modify Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 or set appropriate environment
      variables to override where the program is built (WORKLOAD_BUILD) and
      installed (WORKLOAD_INSTALL) as well as where OCR resides (OCR_INSTALL_ROOT
      and OCR_BUILD_ROOT) and which implementation of OCR to use (OCR_TARGET)
